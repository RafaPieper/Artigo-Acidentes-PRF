# ABSTRACT

This article proposes practical solutions for the southern region of
Brazil related to 3 actions (A5004, A5006, A6020) of the National Plan for
Reducing Traffic Deaths and Injuries (PNATRANS) based on traffic data from
the years 2020 and 2021. Using data science techniques, it evaluates locations
and segments of federal highways with high accident rates in different years. It
was observed locations that stand out in all analyses, and areas that have higher
rates of accident occurrences due to a lack of respect for traffic laws, making it
possible to propose resolutions and places of action for PNATRANS actions.
